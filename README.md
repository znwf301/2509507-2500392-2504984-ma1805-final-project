# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
ASR (A Shattered Reality) is a game about a girl who wakes up one day to the news that her brother has been kidnapped by an evil wizard. The player must explore each map, collect treasuries and fight enemies. The player must fend off enemies encountered throughout the game throuhg a turn based combat system. Strategy and key-decision making is crucial for victory. The main theme is fantasy, where the player is able to explore a world unbeknownst to our own. The game's artstyle is pixel art, to give a retro feel to the game. The message of this game is to never give up no matter the obstacles life puts in your way.

## INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
### <ins> Zack Da Silva </ins>
I was the level designer and dialogue writer of the project. Each level designed had to made up of 50 by 50 pixel tiles so that Andrew can code each tile to have collision. I prototypes each level design so that we get a main idea of where the different functions will be located, for example: fight activations, end-level locations and barriers. I planned the dialogue so that Andrew can simply copy and paste into a text function inside the sketch file. This is so that when the dialogue displayed in the dialogue UI, the speech and actions will be conveyed simply through text. My planning was quite ambitious so some levels were cut down for time and moral purposes.

### <ins> Max Babcock </ins>
My main contributions to the project were all of the art assets for the game itself, including the backgrounds, level tiles, and character icons and sprites. For the overworld level design, using the inital level designs provided to me by Zack, I planned out what type of assets to draw for them, and which assets could be modified in order to reduce workload. After initial sketches and planning, simple character icons were made to show whats where on the map, which would become more detailed when the player entered combat, with GIF sprites made by me being used on both sides. These ended up becoming more simplified due to time constranints.

The code is written in P5JS. P5JS is an OOP (Object Orientated Programming) language. The code works by being inputted into the computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit), Processes by the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) along with the memory unit and control unit. Before it can be processed by the ALU, the code must be converted from a High-level programming language to a low-level programming language (Machine code / Binary) through the use of a compiler. Once the code is finally processed, it is then output on the screen as the game we have created. If you would like to find out how each piece of code works, read the code along with the code comments once they are uploaded.

## THEMES
The main theme of this project is to never give up. With the endless challenged Hecate has to face, the player must direct throught the dangerous fantasy world to test her limitations. It is also designed to empower women, instead of the cliche prince saves princess that is overdone and far too original, we have shone a light to Hecate and conveyed her warrior will-power to save her brother captured by an evil wizard. After finishing the game, the player should feel motivated and satisfied of their progression through some of the most challenging levels we have to offer.  

## DESIGN
The game is designed similarly to a retro style adventure game with dungeon exploration. It uses a tilemap that we used in class to map square locations of the entire canvas so that it could be referenced in code if specific tiles should activate another line of code or be a simpy barrier/collision. To give some originality, we have decided to add a turn-based system similar to RPGs to have some intensity to enemy battles. These are triggered when the player enters the line-of-sight from any given enemy. The player will be given attack and defend options in battle so they will be tested on their decision-making skills. This challenge is designed to enable the player to connect with the character in her battle with the dark forces of the fantasy world. 

## ASTHETIC DIMENSIONS
We were able to settle on a theme early on, and after various team meeting that we held we landed on an artstyle that worked with our setting and was able to be made easily for both the turn based segments as well as the overworld exploration. Leveld designs and ideas as to what structures to have in them were discussed early on, as to make sure we got to work as soon as possible, and enemy design ideas were pitched and then reworked in order to have it fir in with the art style. Given how our overworld has taken inspiration from classic dungeon explorers, a tile map seemed like the best option to convey the adventure theme that is most loved by gamers. 

## UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT

- We were exceptionally optimistic and ambitions when it came to the intial ideas of the project. Originally, we were going to have up to 11 levels for our game. This would have made character development of Hecate more in depth and allowed the player to develop a personal relationship with her. However, due to time constraints and moral of our team we cut it down to only 5 which is much more manageable and safe if anything were to go wrong. It also allowed dialogue to be more simplistic so that only the vital parts of the story are told. 
- Adding on to shortened level count, the artist was originally going to create many types of complicated enemy sprits including bosses for each level. Given how time consuming character designs are made, it was unrealistic to assume the artist would create all sprites to a satisficatory level in the small amount of time we had. By cutting on the levels, we enabled the artist to concentrate on limitted sprites so that each can be made with more precision and less rushed. 
- Adding on to the shortened artistry, the number PNGs have been shorterend down, allowing the zipped file to store less on our computers. With less storage, the game will easily run on many low-process systems computers have - making it more accessible to other people who want to play it. 
- One of the most important featured we had to cut down on is the turn-based complexity. Originally we were going to have more attack options like special moves, magic attacks and much more to diversify combat. But due to time constraints and pressure on the coder it was cut down to just and defend. If we had more time, perhaps we could of implements more attack options to spice the game up a bit.
